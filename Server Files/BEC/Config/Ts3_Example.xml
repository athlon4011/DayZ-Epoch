<!--

Bec will collect ts3 info each 30 seconds.
Due to this, if you have clientrequiredts3 set to 1,  the (clientrequiredts3_warnings) tag should be set to minimum 2 or more.
To ensure that the player gets atleast one warning sent thought, there are times when the player can connect when the ts3 collect loop is on example its 28 second,
this would not give the client time to connect to the ts3 server as he would only have 2 sec on him. and he would be queued up for a kick.

Read the commits on each tag to get a understanding on what they do!
